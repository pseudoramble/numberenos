numberenos-visuals
============================

What is this?
----------------------------

A small React-library to display different statisical sets. Makes use of `numberenos` to show
off it's functionality.

To use the tools
-----------------------------

At this point only development-mode works:

        npm run dev

This will start up a LiveReload server on http://localhost:8080 for you to view and edit.

The starting point of the app is `index.js` which will load the `components/App.jsx`.
Connecting new components would begin in the `components/App.jsx` file.
