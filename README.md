What is this?
----------------------------

A project that provides some of the most basic statistical functions one might want.

There are two main packages right now:

* *numberenos-lib* - The library that contains the statistical functions themselves.
* *numberenos-visual* - A small tool to display numbers on.

See each package for more details.
